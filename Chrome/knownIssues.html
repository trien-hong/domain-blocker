                <p><b>1.)</b> Adding "twitter.com" to block <b>doesn't seem to always work</b> for some reason.</p>
                <p><b>2.)</b> Depending on how the tab is opened and or where the domain was blocked, it <b>may or may not display the correct URL</b>.</p>
                <p><b>3.)</b> Trying to block a website with its path/route <b>"exmaple.com/aboutus" doesn't seem to work</b> on Firefox.</p>
                <p><b>4.)</b> Your list can grow fairly quickly. Depending on the size, it <b>may take some time for options.html/HOME tab to display your list</b>.</p>
                <p><b>5.)</b> It's <b>possible to add things that aren't actually domains/urls/websites/etc.</b>, it just doesn't do anything and take up space.</p>
