                <p>You can virtually add any domain to a list. When you try to visit the website it'll redirect you to 1 of 10 random extension page.</p>
                <p>That is assuming you have added the domain to the list. To block a domain, go to the extension options page and add the website there.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, ad blockers don't block everything on a website. By manually adding the domain of the ad you should be able to block it.</p>
